## API of cities
In this assignment we will practice the use of Http verbs (use the right verb for the right purpose)

+ Create your own in-memory database, this can be an array of different cities or countries. The choice is yours. 

+ Create a middleware to display a list of all the different cities/countries inside the database 
+ Create a middleware to add a new city/country to the in-memory database
+ Create a middleware to update one city/country inside the in-memory database. 
+ Create a middleware to delete one city/country


## Extra 

+ Make sure the port number of the webserver is set through a environment variable (hint: dotenv and use of .env)
